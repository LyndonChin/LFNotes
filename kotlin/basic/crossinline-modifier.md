Sometimes we need to use function type parameters from inline functions not directly in the function body, but in another execution context, such as a local object or a nested function. But standard function type parameters of inline functions are not allowed to be used this way because they allow non-local returns, which should not be allowed if this function could be used inside another execution context.
