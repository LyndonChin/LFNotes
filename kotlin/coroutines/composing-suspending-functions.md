```kotlin
suspend fun doSomethingUsefulOne(): Int {
    delay(1000L) // pretend we are doing something useful here
    return 13
}

suspend fun doSomethingUsefulTwo(): Int {
    delay(1000L) // pretend we are doing something useful here, too
    return 29
}
```

Sequential by default
---
```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) = runBlocking<Unit> {
    val time = measureTimeMillis {
        val one = doSomethingUsefulOne()
        val two = doSomethingUsefulTwo()
        println("The answer is ${one + two}")
    }
    println("Completed in $time ms")
}
```

Concurrent using async
---
```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) = runBlocking<Unit> {
    val time = measureTimeMillis {
        val one = async { doSomethingUsefulOne() }
        val two = async { doSomethingUsefulTwo() }
        println("The answer is ${one.await()} + ${two.await()}")
    }
    println("Completed in $time ms")
}
```

Lazily started async
---
```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) = runBlocking<Unit> {
    val time = measureTimeMillis {
        val one = async(start = CoroutineStart.LAZY) { doSomethingUsefulOne() }
        val two = async(start = CoroutineStart.LAZY) { doSomethingUsefulTwo() }
        println("The answer is ${one.await() + two.await()}")
    }
    println("Completed in $time ms")
}
```

> It is not the intended use-case for laziness. It is designed as a replacement for the standard `lazy` function in cases when computation of the value involves suspending functions.

Async-style functions
---

```kotlin
// The result type of somethingUsefulOneAsync is Deferred<Int>
fun somethingUsefulOneAsync() = async {
    doSomethingUsefulOne()
}

// The result type of somethingUsefulTwoAsync is Deferred<Int>
fun somethingUsefulOneAsync() = async {
    doSomethingUsefulOne()
}
```

```kotlin
// note, that we don't have `runBlocking` to the right of `main` in this example
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val time = measureTimeMillis {
        // we can initiate async actions outside of a coroutine
        val one = somethingUsefulOneAsync()
        val two = somethingUsefulTwoAsync()
        // but waiting for a result must involve either suspending or blocking.
        // here we use `runBlocking { ... }` to block the main thred while waiting for the result
        runBlocking {
            println("The answer is ${one.await() + two.await()}")
        }
    }
    println("Completed in $time ms")
}
```
